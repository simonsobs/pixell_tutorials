        "## About `pixell` and `ndmap` objects\n",
        "\n",
        "The `pixell` library supports manipulation of sky maps that are represented as 2-dimensional grids of rectangular pixels. The supported projection and pixelization schemes are a subset of the schemes supported by FITS conventions. In addition, we provide support for a *plain* coordinate system, corresponding to a Cartesian plane with identically shaped pixels (useful for true flat-sky calculations).\n",
        "\n",
        "In `pixell`, a map is encapsulated in an `ndmap`, which combines two objects: a numpy array (of at least two dimensions) whose two trailing dimensions correspond to two coordinate axes of the map, and a `wcs` object that specifies the World Coordinate System. The `wcs` component is an instance of Astropy’s `astropy.wcs.wcs.WCS` class. The combination of the wcs and the shape of the numpy array completely specifies the footprint of a map of the sky, and is called the `geometry`. This library helps with manipulation of `ndmap` objects in ways that are aware of and preserve the validity of the wcs information.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `wcs` information describes the correspondence between celestial coordinates (typically the Right Ascension, or RA, in the Equatorial system) and the pixel indices in the two right-most axes. In some projections, such as CEA or CAR, rows (and columns) of the pixel grid will often follow lines of constant declination (and RA). In other projections, this will not be the case.\n",
        "\n",
        "The WCS system is very flexible in how celestial coordinates may be associated with the pixel array. By observing certain conventions, we can make life easier for users of our maps. We recommend the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "The first pixel, index [0,0], should be the one that you would normally display (on a monitor or printed figure) in the lower left-hand corner of the image. The pixel indexed by [0,1] should appear to the right of [0,0], and pixel [1,0] should be above pixel [0,0]. (This recommendation originates in FITS standards documentation.)\n",
        "When working with large maps that are not near the celestial poles, RA should be roughly horizontal and declination should be roughly vertical. (It should go without saying that you should also present information “as it would appear on the sky”, i.e. with RA increasing to the left!)\n",
        "The examples in the rest of this document are designed to respect these two conventions."
